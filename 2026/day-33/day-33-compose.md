## Challenge Tasks

### Task 1: Install & Verify

1. Check if Docker Compose is available on your machine
2. Verify the version

---

### Task 2: Your First Compose File

1. Create a folder `compose-basics`
2. Write a `docker-compose.yml` that runs a single **Nginx** container with port mapping
3. Start it with `docker compose up`
4. Access it in your browser
5. Stop it with `docker compose down`

---

### Task 3: Two-Container Setup

Write a `docker-compose.yml` that runs:

- A **WordPress** container
- A **MySQL** container

They should:

- Be on the same network (Compose does this automatically)
- MySQL should have a named volume for data persistence
- WordPress should connect to MySQL using the service name

Start it, access WordPress in your browser, and set it up.

**Verify:** Stop and restart with `docker compose down` and `docker compose up` — is your WordPress data still there?

---

### Task 4: Compose Commands

Practice and document these:

1. Start services in **detached mode** `docker compose up -d`
2. View running services `docker compose ps`
3. View **logs** of all services `docker compose logs`
4. View logs of a **specific** service `docker compose logs -f wordpress`
5. **Stop** services without removing `docker compose stop`
6. **Remove** everything (containers, networks) `docker compose down`
7. **Rebuild** images if you make a change `docker compose up -d --build`

---

### Task 5: Environment Variables

1. Add environment variables directly in your `docker-compose.yml`

2. Create a `.env` file and reference variables from it in your compose file

```bash
.env file
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=Test@123
MYSQL_DATABASE=wordpressappdb
WORDPRESS_PORT=8080
```

3. Verify the variables are being picked up

- To verify
  `docker compose exec wordpress env | grep WORDPRESS_DB`
  `docker compose exec mysql env | grep MYSQL`
  `docker compose exec wordpress printenv`
